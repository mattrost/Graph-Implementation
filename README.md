# Graph-Implementation

Two Python programs that provide implementations of an undirected, unweighted graph and a directed, weighted graph. The undirected, unweighted graph is represented as an adjacency list and the directed, weighted graph is represented as an adjancency matrix.

#Undirected Graph Methods
Ability to add and remove vertices and edges from the graph
Determines whether a provided path is valid or not
Depth-first search
Breadth-first search
Count connected components
Cycle detection

#Directed Graph Methods
Ability to add and remove vertices and edges from the graph
Determines whether or a provided path is valid or not
Depth-first search
Breadth-first search
Cycle detection
Dijkstra's Algorithm to determine shortest path between vertices
